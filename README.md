Project Title: Polyline Manipulation and Visualization
Overview:
This project focuses on reading, manipulating, and visualizing polylines extracted from CSV and SVG files. The project includes functionality to regularize, manipulate, and fit polylines to geometric shapes like rectangles or circles, ensuring smooth and accurate visual representations.

Features:
Read Polylines from CSV and SVG: The project provides functions to extract polylines from CSV files and SVG files using svgpathtools.
Polyline Visualization: The polylines can be visualized using matplotlib, allowing easy inspection of their shape and alignment.
Regularization of Polylines: Implements techniques to regularize polylines, including straightening lines and detecting symmetry.
Curve Completion: Ability to complete curves by interpolating missing points, ensuring that incomplete shapes are handled correctly.
Geometric Shape Fitting: Functions to manipulate polylines to fit into the nearest rectangle or circle, simplifying complex shapes while preserving essential geometry.
Simplification and Manipulation: Using libraries like shapely, the project simplifies polylines with a specified tolerance and fits them to geometric shapes.
